    There are 100 light bulbs lined up in a row in a long room. Each bulb has its own
    switch and is currently switched off. The room has an entry door and an exit door.
    There are 100 people lined up outside the entry door. Each bulb is numbered consecutively
    from 1 to 100. So is each person. Person No. 1 enters the room, switches on every bulb,
    and exits. Person No. 2 enters and flips the switch on every second bulb (turning off
    bulbs 2, 4, 6, ...). Person No. 3 enters and flips the switch on every third bulb (changing
    the state on bulbs 3, 6, 9, ...). This continues until all 100 people have passed through the
    room. How many of the light bulbs are illuminated after the 100th person has passed through
    the room? More specifically, which light bulbs are still illuminated, and why?

    The result should have a GUI to input the number of people and the number of
    light bulbs. It should output which light bulbs are on at the end and how many. An ideal
    submission will contain an ASP.NET web app.
